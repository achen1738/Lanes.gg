# lanes.gg
I wanted to create a website that functioned similar to na.op.gg, which analyzed match data for a popular game called League of Legends but focused on a completely different aspect of a specific match. Currently, na.op.gg displays essentially the box score, or end the end result of a match. However, I wanted to display data that happened at various points of the game, showing users how the game developed to its outcome. For example, this website can show users what happened in each lane for the first ~18 minutes, which is what I consider as the laning phase, to what happened in the mid to late game where players start to move around more. The end goal of this website is to be able to help players improve their own gameplay by highlighting either their own mistakes or highlighting what professionals do better

## Currently making major revisions!
I will update a bunch of information as I reach the end of my winter break. I will keep what the website looked previously, but hopefully it will look better in the future.

## To Do (Currently working on it again!)
There is a bunch I want to change, I want to eventually use actual frameworks like ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS for the backend. I also need a database to store data for each region, and I'm going to try to use GraphQL/TSQL.
